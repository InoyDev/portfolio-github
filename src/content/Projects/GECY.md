#### Context and challenges

As part of my job as ERP Project Manager for the Cellino Group. I identified a problem in the production processes at one of the group's sites, which after discussions was also present at a large number of other sites.

To put this into context, production orders (POs) go through several stages before ending up as a finished product. Between each operation, for example between cutting and folding, some production orders are temporarily stored due to bottlenecks that prevent them from being processed immediately. These POs are known as work-in-process stocks.

Until now, these intermediate stocks were managed on paper, a system that was slow, unreliable and rarely updated. This lack of digital tracking meant that considerable time was lost in locating POs when they had to be reintegrated into the production process.

The challenges of the project were several:
- To speed up the search for POs in order to improve the flow of production and avoid interruptions.
- Make data more reliable by eliminating errors associated with manual data entry.
- Real-time monitoring of stock entries and removals.

The solution chosen consisted in developing a mobile application
enabling the registration and instant consultation of
work-in-progress storage locations via a data entry and
digital search system.

#### Deployment and Outcomes

##### A - Production launch and adoption by teams

Once the application had been developed, it was rolled out on the shop floor in a number of stages:

- Installation of QR codes on each storage location to enable rapid entry via a scanner.
- Training operators to use the application to ensure rapid adoption.
- Gradual integration into production processes, with tests under real conditions to adjust the final parameters before large-scale use.

##### B - Gains and benefits

Initial results show significant gains in productivity and data accuracy:

- Reduction in POs research time, thus improving the fluidity of production.
- Real-time monitoring of work-in-progress stocks, enabling better priority management.
- Secure access, preventing errors and ensuring better traceability.
- Intuitive, user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to adopt.

##### C - Outlook for the future

The GECY application is designed to be scalable and could eventually:

- Be deployed on all Solustil sites in order to standardise the management of work-in-progress stocks.
- Manage other types of stock, in addition to work-in-progress, according to identified needs.
- Be directly connected to the new ERP/MES, for centralised and automated management.
