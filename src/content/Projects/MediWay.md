#### University project

The aim of this project is to develop an itinerary management application for health clinics. As part of a humanitarian mission, a network of different types of health clinic (health centre, pharmacy, maternity unit) needs a powerful, high-performance and reliable tool to efficiently manage the routing of patients, carers and medicines. To achieve this, the network of clinics and the routes linking them are represented by a graph extracted from a csv file. The aim is also to use a relevant graph traversal algorithm to optimise execution times.

This project was carried out in pairs throughout the second semester of my first year of my Bachelor's degree. Carrying out this project under ‚Äúreal‚Äù conditions, with the drawing up of specifications, monitoring the project using an agile method, complying with rigorous technical requirements and carrying out a final presentation, gave me a real first experience of what a full-scale project is like.

It also enabled me to acquire and consolidate a number of technical skills:
- Managing a complex git project
- Planning and distributing tasks on a large-scale project
- Developing a complete Java application with Maven
- Creating an interface with Swing
- Implementing the graph traversal algorithm (Dijkstra)
- Creating and managing unit tests with JUnit

#### Features

The application has been designed to provide users with the widest possible range of functions and customisation options:

- Management of the file that stores the graph
- Viewing the graph and customising the visual
- Modifying the graph directly in the file (residents, routes)
- Displaying residents according to several criteria (type, neighbourhood, route)
- Giving the route according to different factors (journey time, length, reliability, residents travelled)
