#### Context and aims
The project involved creating an online sales website specialising in sneakers. The guiding principle of the project was to create a complete sales platform specialising in sneakers, while making it easy to keep up with current trends. This site was created in collaboration with 3 other colleagues and presented as part of a university project.

The creation of this online shop involved a series of complex tasks, including managing products in a database, managing accounts (creation, connection, storage), linking the account to a third-party site (Google, Github), adding an e-mail checker, integrating a payment system, creating complex administrator functions and much more.


#### What I gained from the project

This project has given me a deep expertise in various technologies and in project management. I acquired practical skills in front-end development with ReactJS and NextJS, and back-end development with NodeJS and Prisma. Deploying on Vercel and using Cloudflare, Stripe and Planet Scale enriched my knowledge of online hosting and payment solutions.

In terms of project management, I learned to use collaborative tools such as Discord, GitLab, Asana, Figma, and Notion, which improved my ability to coordinate tasks, manage versions, and track project progress in an efficient and organised way using the Agile method.
